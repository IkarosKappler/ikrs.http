# For testing: an entry in Apache(!) MD5 hash encryption format (not supported)
# Note: to create an apache password, type
#  htpassword -n <username> [<password>]
#
# The format is:
#   - $apr1$    Indicates that this hash is an Apache-MD5 sum
#   - Px0gsAPk  [example] The salt for the password encryption.
#   - JW2A...   The hashed password; 
#     		calculated with MD5( user + ":" + realm + ":" + password )
# Example 1:
# testuser:$apr1$Px0gsAPk$JW2APdbEhGlT5bLfqua2C1
# Example 2:
# testuser:$apr1$.Fw8RG60$AL1VH6Oztgng2/nXdqgQ5.



# This is my own implementation --- until I fully understand the Apache MD5 ;)
# The value consists of
#  - {ikrs.http.MD5}    My identifier.
#  - 12345678 		The salt (such as in Apache MD5).
#  - xxxx...		The acutual MD5 hash (32 hex-chars).
#    			Calculated with MD5( user + ":" + realm + ":" + password )
# testuser:${ikrs.http.MD5}$MpHQcXUb$9f8d6ab4029a6f8ce8fcdbdb7e671490
