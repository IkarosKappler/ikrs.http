THIS IS JUST A DUMMY FILE.

In this file's directory there is also an .htaccess file with an 
AddHandler directive.

The directive adds the 'light-db-example-handler' and associates it with the
.lightdb extension of THIS file.

The 'light-db-example-handler' is a java-written class implementing the 
ikrs.httpd.FileHandler interface.


See the filehandlers.ini inside your {USER_HOME}/.yuccasrc/ directory
if you want to know how to specify such a customized FileHandler.
It's easy and done with only one configuration line!



Result
------
When this file is accessed via HTTP the HTTPHandler calls the specified
file handler class and passes the whole request. Now it's completely up 
to the LightDBExampleHandler instance to process the request!


The same applies to *all* files with the .lightdb extension within
the same directory OR any sub-directories.



Have fun!
