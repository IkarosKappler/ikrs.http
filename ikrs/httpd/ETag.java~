/**
 * The ETag (entity tag) is sort of a resource hash. It is built of the 
 * resource's name, the resource's size (if available) and the 
 * resource's date of last modification; if the modification date is 
 * unknown the current time stamp is used, so each time it is called a 
 * new hash is generated (the resource might have changed in between).
