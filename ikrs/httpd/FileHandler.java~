/**
 * This FileHandler interface is meant for HTTP resources that represent executable files (in any way)
 * inside the document root (such as CGI scripts, system commands, executables, ...).
 *
 * As configuration files such as .htaccess allow to define file handlers (AddHandler and SetHandler 
 * directives) there is the need to summarize those handlers together under one general interface.
 *
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: subclasses should implement a empty-argument-list constructor to make the
 *                      class instantiable using the Class.newInstance() method!
