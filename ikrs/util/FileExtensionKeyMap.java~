 * As there is a small issue mapping file extensions in different styles; if you store
 * a file extension ".txt" to this map (key) looking up ".TXT" or "txt" won't retrieve
 * the mapped value if using a regular String orientated map.
 *
 * This map uses a case-insensitive key comparator (so ".txt" and ".TXT" are the same)
 * and handles the preceding dot "." (so ".txt" and "txt" are the same).
